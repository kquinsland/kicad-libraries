# Misc/Assorted collection of KiCad libraries

This repo contains a mix of KiCad libraries that I've created or modified.

I got tired of copy/pasting the same footprints over and over again so I decided to put them in a repo with the intent of using this repo as a sub-module in other project repos since KiCad doesn't have good support for sharing footprints between projects with version control.

## TODO

Would be nice to GHA CI/CD to automatically generate images of the footprints and add them to the readme.
