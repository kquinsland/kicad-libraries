# Updating symbols

There is - unfortunately - no way to [launch the symbol editor in "standalone" mode](https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/issues/15950) the same way you can `pcbnew` or `eeschema`.

So if you want to make a correction to any of the symbols that were generated by `easyeda2kicad`, you'll have to do it from within the KiCad project that you're using the symbol in.... except then you'll only create a LOCAL update and no change will get pushed back to this repo.

Annoying as hell, but whatever.

I created a basic project in `_kicad/_kicad.kicad_pro` to "own" the libraries in this repo.
Changes to anything can be made there, saved and then pushed back to this repo.
