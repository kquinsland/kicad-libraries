	(descr "At the desired position, add a white square to the silkscreen layer to match your 2D barcode size. For Number-only printing, use a 2x10mm white square. If no square of a matching size is found, the 2D barcode will not be added at your specified location.If there isn't enough space on the board to add the 2D barcode, we may decide not to print it and will not accept complaints regarding this issue.\n\nâ‘¡ Considerations:\n\nTo ensure the 2D barcode can be scanned correctly, position it away from traces, drilling, soldermask apertures, and other silkscreen patterns (preferably on large copper surfaces or exposed substrate areas).As this is a free customization service, we do not accept liability for any scanning issues or refund claims due to service failures.")
